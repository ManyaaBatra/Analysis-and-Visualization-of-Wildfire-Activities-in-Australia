# Analysis-and-Visualization-of-Wildfire-Activities-in-Australia
Exploratory data analysis and interactive dashboard project analyzing wildfire activities across Australian regions using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, and Dash.

This project explores wildfire activities across various regions of Australia using historical wildfire data from 2005 onwards. The analysis focuses on identifying temporal trends, regional patterns, and the impact of wildfire intensity metrics.

The project is divided into two major components: Data Analysis & Visualization & Interactive Dashboard Development

Dataset Description - The dataset includes:

Region – 7 Australian regions ; Date – Observation date (UTC) ; Estimated Fire Area (km²) ; Mean Fire Brightness (Kelvin); Radiative Power (MW); Confidence Levels; Pixel Count of Fire Detections; Data Quality Indicators

Part 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis

Key Analyses:
Change in average estimated fire area over time; Monthly wildfire trends; Regional fire brightness comparison; Pixel count distribution across regions; Correlation between radiative power and confidence; Mapping wildfire-affected regions using Folium

Part 2 – Interactive Dashboard
Dashboard Features: Region selection , Year selection , Monthly average estimated fire area (Pie chart),  Monthly average fire pixel count (Bar chart) ,  Dynamic filtering, Responsive layout

Technologies Used
Python; Pandas; Matplotlib; Seaborn; Plotly
